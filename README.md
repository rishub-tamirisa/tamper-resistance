# 🛡️ Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs 🤖

We introduce a novel method, Tampering Attack Resistance (TAR), which is the first defense to withstand a significant number of open-weight fine-tuning attacks on LLMs, while preserving model capabilities.

## 🛡️ What are Tamper-Resistant Safeguards? 🛡️

Tamper-Resistant Safeguards are security measures designed for open-weight large language models (LLMs) to protect against malicious modifications of the model's weights. Unlike traditional safeguards that focus on preventing input-based attacks, these advanced safeguards prevent adversaries with access to full model weights from recovering performance on harmful capabilities. We demonstrate in our extensive red-teaming evaluation that Tamper-Resistant Safeguards created via TAR are the first to be robust to a significant number of open-weight fine-tuning attacks.

## 🌐 Overview 🌐

This repository contains implementations for TAR (including the Random Mapping initial safeguard), red-teaming evaluation, and baseline methods. The current implementation assumes that models from 🤗 Transformers, meaning they have the expected configs, subclasses, etc. However, in principle the FSDP wrapping can be made compatible with any model. We plan to update the code to be more agnostic when we migrate to FSDP v2.

## ☕ Quick Start ☕

### 📦 Setup

1.  Clone and enter the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rishub-tamirisa/tamper-resistance.git
    cd tamper-resistance
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Setup the dotenv (`.env`):
    - In the root level of the repository, create a `.env` file following the format of the included `dotenv` file.
    - We've already included the FSDP configs used for running the method in the `configs` folder. You can use these or create your own. For running TAR with FSDP v1, it's important that `fsdp_use_orig_params=false` and `fsdp_sharding_strategy=1`.
    - Finally, set the environment variables:
      ```bash
      source .env
      ```


> [!CAUTION]
> Do not push your `.env` file to a public repository. Since it contains your Huggingface token and other secrets, it could lead to unauthorized access to your Huggingface account. We've already included it in the `.gitignore` file to prevent this.
  

### 🛠️ Running Tamper-Resistance Training

We provide scripts in the root-level folder for running TAR for biosecurity and cybersecurity: `run_tar_bio.sh` and `run_tar_cyber.sh`.


It's recommended to run Llama-3-8B-Instruct models (or similar size) on systems with `8xA100 80G` or larger due to full-parameter training and other overheads introduced by the first-order meta-learning implementation.

With the appropriate GPU setup, and assuming the `.env` is correctly set, simply run:

```bash
sh run_tar_bio.sh
```

## 🤗 Models and Datasets

We release models and datasets used to replicate the Bio and Cyber experiments in our paper here: [🤗 Huggingface Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/lapisrocks/tamper-resistant-safeguards-for-open-weight-llms-66b2dc4cc40442c79ec890a5).
